ALCYON + MathData Hackathon
============================

Wednesday 30 April 2025
-----------------------

On 30/04/2025 we will have our first hackathon, taking place in the ALCYON lab at GTU.

Please [register here](https://forms.gle/bpPZJMe8pgyr1ZRd9) (mostly to know how much pizza is needed).

The goal of the hackathon is to combine work we all did (through research, bitirme projects, other coding, etc) into one functional system.

We will follow standard procedures and best practices of open source projects and this will be a fun and useful experience for all of us.
